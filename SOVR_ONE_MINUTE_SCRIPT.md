# SOVR - One Minute Script

## The Spoken Constitution

**This is how you explain SOVR in 60 seconds.**

**Use this script verbatim.**

**Do not improvise.**

**Memorize this.**

---

### SCRIPT START

"SOVR is a ledger-cleared obligation network.

It does not process payments.
It does not custody funds.
It does not promise redemption.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Intent** – A user expresses a claim
2. **Attestation** – The claim is validated
3. **Clearing** – The obligation is finalized
4. **Honoring** – External agents may execute (optional)

Truth is mechanical, not narrative.
If it did not clear in TigerBeetle, it did not happen.

A cleared obligation does not imply, guarantee, or compel honoring.

Fiat is optional.
Banks are adapters.
The system survives because it refuses control."

### SCRIPT END

## Stress-Tested Variations

### Variation 1: Regulator Questioning

**Q:** "Where is the money held?"

**A:** "There are no held funds. There are only cleared obligations and voluntary honoring."

---

**Q:** "How do you prevent fraud?"

**A:** "Legitimacy is proven before clearing. Unattested claims are void."

---

**Q:** "What happens if a payment fails?"

**A:** "There are no payments. There are only cleared obligations. Honoring is external and optional."

---

### Variation 2: Anchor Concerns

**Q:** "Will you guarantee my orders are fulfilled?"

**A:** "No. We clear obligations. Honoring is your choice, not our guarantee."

---

**Q:** "What if we refuse an order?"

**A:** "The obligation remains cleared. No rollback. No reversal. No system involvement."

---

**Q:** "How do we know this is safe?"

**A:** "Truth is mechanical. No central control. No custodial risk. No fiat dependency."

---

### Variation 3: Operator Training

**Q:** "Can I manually adjust a balance?"

**A:** "No. Balances are mathematical results of finalized transfers. They are never edited."

---

**Q:** "What if something goes wrong?"

**A:** "Failures require new transfers, not edits. Admins observe. They do not correct reality."

---

**Q:** "How do I explain this to users?"

**A:** "Use the one-minute script. Do not improvise. Memorize it."

## Memorization Guide

### Break it into 5 parts:

1. **Definition** (10 sec)
   - "SOVR is a ledger-cleared obligation network."

2. **What it does NOT do** (10 sec)
   - "It does not process payments."
   - "It does not custody funds."
   - "It does not promise redemption."

3. **How it works** (20 sec)
   - "1. Intent – A user expresses a claim"
   - "2. Attestation – The claim is validated"
   - "3. Clearing – The obligation is finalized"
   - "4. Honoring – External agents may execute (optional)"

4. **Core principles** (15 sec)
   - "Truth is mechanical, not narrative."
   - "If it did not clear in TigerBeetle, it did not happen."
   - "A cleared obligation does not imply, guarantee, or compel honoring."

5. **Survival property** (5 sec)

## Hostile Questioning Defense

### Attack: "This sounds like a bank."

**Response:**
"Banks custody funds and promise redemption. We clear obligations and make no guarantees."

---

### Attack: "You’re just another payment processor."

**Response:**
"Payment processors route value. We finalize obligations. Honoring is external."

---

### Attack: "Where’s the money?"

**Response:**
"There is no money. There are only cleared obligations and voluntary honoring."

---

### Attack: "This will never work without fiat."

**Response:**
"Fiat is optional. The moment a cleared obligation is honored without referencing fiat, fiat becomes irrelevant."

## Common Mistakes (Do NOT Say These)

❌ "We process payments"
✅ "We clear obligations"

❌ "User funds are held securely"
✅ "Cleared obligations exist"

❌ "Balances are updated daily"
✅ "Balances are mathematical results"

❌ "Payments are settled"
✅ "Obligations are cleared"

❌ "Fiat on/off ramps available"
✅ "External value translation adapters"

## Final Verification

**Ask yourself:**

1. Can I say this in under 60 seconds?
2. Does it use only allowed terms?
3. Does it avoid all forbidden language?
4. Does it survive hostile questioning?
5. Can operators memorize it?

If yes to all five, you are ready.

**This is the spoken constitution of SOVR.**

**Use it. Memorize it. Defend it.**
